## Profile
Praise is a skilled professional with experience as a Research Assistant at the University of Southern California, Software DevOPs Engineer at Leslie's, and Software Engineer at Boterna. His responsibilities have included leveraging data analysis and machine learning techniques, conducting data preprocessing and analysis, and enhancing system performance through design and construction. He has hands-on experience in Docker, Kubernetes and, KubeFlow for developing scalable machine learning applications and in various programming languages like Python, Java, and SQL, along with specializations in Generative AI, MLOps, and Natural Language Processing.

## Projects
1.    Emotional State Classification:  Authored a paper on the impact of maternal emotional state on mother-infant interactions, analyzing 235 videos spanning 13 hours. Developed a multimodal deep learning model using facial and audio features, achieving 96% accuracy in predicting maternal depression 
2.    Deep Learning for Image Compression:  Utilized a stable diffusion model for image compression, resulting in a 9% efficiency gain and an 8% improvement in PSNR while maintaining SSIM integrity. Additionally, leveraging the Space-Time U-Net technique led to an impressive 800x compression ratio in videos 
3.    Automated Audio Insights Pipeline:  Utilized Amazon Bedrock to architect an event-driven pipeline for providing insights on audio recordings of two speakers, with automation facilitated by AWS Lambda. Initiated the workflow with Amazon Transcribe for audio-to-text conversion and diarization, followed by processing the transcribed text, with prompt engineering, through an LLM, using Amazon's Titan framework, for insight generation
4.    On-time Flight Tracking:  Developed and deployed an airline on-time arrival prediction model using the mirrored distributed training strategy for faster learning, achieving 81% accuracy. Utilized GCP Vertex AI for both online and batch inference deployments. Also, incorporated a Sampled-Shapley method-based eXplainable AI (XAI) model to offer prediction insights 
5.    RAG Chatbot:  Leveraging the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Workflow, I developed an enhanced chatbot proficient in accurately answering questions by accessing information in its vector store. Enforced diversity and relevance in search results using Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR). Utilized LangChain framework alongside OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo as the Large Language Model (LLM)
6.    RLHF FineTuning:  Fine-tuned the FLAN-T5 model via RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback) to produce less-toxic summaries. Integrated the proximal policy optimization (PPO) RL algorithm and the LoRA reparameterization method for efficient parameter fine-tuning. Incorporated META AI's hate speech model as the reward mechanism and utilized the DialogSum Dataset from HFðŸ¤— for training. Achieved a mean toxicity score improvement of 53.88%
