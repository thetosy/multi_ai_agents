Subscribe   On Tuesday, analysts on Google’s quarterly conference call peppered chief executive Sundar Pichai with questions about when the company’s $12-billion-a-quarter investment in AI would begin paying off. And in the past few weeks, big Wall Street investment banks including Goldman Sachs and Barclays, as well as VCs such as Sequoia Capital, have issued reports raising concerns about the sustainability of the AI gold rush, arguing that the technology might not be able to make the kind of money to justify the billions being invested into it. Stock prices for big AI names including Google, Microsoft and Nvidia are all up significantly this year.  “Despite its expensive price tag, the technology is nowhere near where it needs to be in order to be useful,” Jim Covello, Goldman Sachs’s most senior stock analyst and a 30-year veteran of covering tech companies, said in a recent report about AI. “Overbuilding things the world doesn’t have use for, or is not ready for, typically ends badly.” Covello’s comments are in sharp contrast to a different Goldman Sachs report from just over a year ago, in which some of the bank’s economists said AI could automate 300 million jobs around the world and increase global economic output by 7 percent in the next 10 years, spurring a spate of news coverage about the disruptive potential of AI. Barclays said Wall Street analysts are expecting Big Tech companies to spend around $60 billion a year on developing AI models by 2026, but reap only around $20 billion a year in revenue from AI by that point. That kind of investment would be enough to power 12,000 products of a similar size to OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Barclays analysts wrote in a recent report. OpenAI released ChatGPT in November 2022, kicking off a race in Silicon Valley to build new AI products and get people to use them. Big Tech companies are spending tens of billions of dollars on the technology. Retail investors have bid up the price of those companies and their suppliers, especially Nvidia, which makes the computer chips used to train AI models. Year to date, shares of Google parent Alphabet are up 25 percent, Microsoft is up 15 percent, and Nvidia shares are up 140 percent. Venture capitalists have also poured billions more into thousands of AI start-ups. The AI boom has helped contribute to the $55.6 billion that venture investors put into U.S. start-ups in the second quarter of 2024, the highest amount in a single quarter in two years, according to venture capital data firm PitchBook. Tech executives insist that AI will change whole swaths of modern life, in the same way the internet or mobile phones did. AI technology has indeed improved drastically and is already being used to translate documents, write emails and help programmers code. But concern over whether the tech industry will be able to recoup the billions of dollars it’s investing in AI anytime soon — or ever — has risen among some firms that only last year were heralding the boom. “We do expect lots of new services … but probably not 12,000 of them,” Barclays analysts wrote. “We sense that Wall Street is growing increasingly skeptical.” In April, Meta, Google and Nvidia all signaled their commitment to going all in on AI by telling investors during quarterly earnings calls that they would ramp up the amount of money they’re spending on building data centers to train and run AI algorithms. Google reiterated Tuesday it would spend more than $12 billion a quarter on its AI build-out. Microsoft and Meta are due to report their own earnings next week and may give further indication about their AI road maps. Pichai said Tuesday that it would take time for AI products to mature and become more useful. He acknowledged the high cost of AI but said even if the AI boom slows down, the data centers and computer chips the company was buying could be put to other uses. “The risk of underinvesting is dramatically greater than the risk of overinvesting for us,” Pichai said. “Not investing to be at the front here has much more significant downsides.” A spokesperson for Microsoft declined to comment. A spokesperson for Meta did not respond to a request for comment.  Unrealistic expectations  Vinod Khosla, who co-founded computer network systems company Sun Microsystems and is one of Silicon Valley’s most influential venture-capital investors, compared AI to personal computers, the internet and mobile phones in terms of how much it would affect society. “These are all fundamentally new platforms. In each of these, every new platform causes a massive explosion in applications,” Khosla said. The rush into AI might cause a financial bubble where investors lose money, but that doesn’t mean the underlying technology won’t continue to grow and become more important, he said. “There was a dot-com bubble, according to Goldman Sachs, because prices went up and prices went down. According to me, internet traffic didn’t go down at all.” As AI changes the way people work, do business and interact with one another, many start-ups will fail, he said. But overall the industry will make money on AI. He predicts there will eventually be multiple trillion-dollar businesses in AI, such as humanoid robots, AI assistants and programs that can completely replicate the work of highly paid software engineers. But so far, AI is not contributing to an increase in venture capital getting a return on those investments. The amount of money made in venture capital exits, which represent initial public offerings or acquisitions of tech start-ups, fell to $23.6 billion in the second quarter, down slightly from $25.4 billion the previous quarter, according to PitchBook. The tech industry would need to generate around $600 billion in revenue a year to make up for all the money being invested in AI right now, yet it is far from close to that number, David Cahn, a partner at venture firm Sequoia Capital, wrote in a blog post last month. “Speculative frenzies are part of technology, and so they are not something to be afraid of,” Cahn said. “But we need to make sure not to believe in the delusion that has now spread from Silicon Valley to the rest of the country, and indeed the world. That delusion says that we’re all going to get rich quick.”  Microsoft’s and Google’s revenue are growing, especially in their cloud businesses where they sell access to AI algorithms and the storage space to use them. Executives from the companies say AI is driving new interest in their products and will become a major moneymaker in the future. But some analysts are pointing out that there have been very few hugely successful stand-alone products, besides OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Microsoft’s coding assistant GitHub Copilot. “Wall Street is growing increasingly skeptical given that ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot are the two breakout successes in consumer and enterprise thus far 20 months in,” the Barclays analysts wrote in their report. The cost of developing and running AI programs will come down as other companies compete with Nvidia and the technology becomes more efficient, said Vineet Jain, CEO of Egnyte, an AI and data management company. For now, the cost of providing AI products is too expensive, and he doesn’t expect to make any AI-specific revenue this year. But as costs go down and demand continues to rise, that will change, Jain said. “The value proposition is absolutely there, but the expectation right now is still unrealistic,” he said, referring to the frenzy to sell AI products to consumers and businesses. Some start-ups have already come down from the heights of the early part of the AI boom. Inflection AI, a start-up founded by veterans of Google’s famous DeepMind AI lab, raised $1.3 billion last year to build out their chatbot business. But in March, the company’s founders left for jobs at Microsoft, taking some of their top employees with them to the tech giant. Other AI companies, like Stability AI, which was one of the first companies to build a widely popular AI image generator, have had to lay off workers. The industry is also facing lawsuits and regulatory challenges. Bigger companies like Google and Microsoft will be able to keep spending money until demand for AI products increases, but smaller start-ups that have taken on a lot of venture capital might not survive the transition, Jain said. “It’s like a soufflé that keeps popping up and popping up, it has to come down a bit.”  ||||I|||| Accessibility statementSkip to main content\n",

      "Text: Advertisement  SKIP ADVERTISEMENT    The prominent A.I. start-up said it planned to eventually fold the new technology into its popular online chatbot, ChatGPT.           July 25, 2024,       OpenAI is testing an AI-powered search engine that can access information from across the internet in real time. The prominent A.I. start-up revealed the new prototype, called SearchGPT, in a blog post on Thursday. The company said it was testing the technology with a small group of users as well as online publishers who partnered with OpenAI to help build the search engine. “Getting answers on the web can take a lot of effort, often requiring multiple attempts to get relevant results,” the company said in its blog post. “We believe that by enhancing the conversational capabilities of our models with real-time information from the web, finding what you’re looking for can be faster and easier.” OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for additional comment. Other companies have built similar technologies, including tech giants like Google and Microsoft, as well as start-ups like the San Francisco-based company Perplexity. These services augment traditional internet search engines with chatbot technology that generates text as a way of answering questions and summarizing online information.   OpenAI plans to integrate its new search engine technology with its existing online chatbot, ChatGPT, which launched the A.I. boom when it was released in November 2022. The company said that its new technology would respond to questions with up-to-date information from the web while also providing links to relevant sources. For instance, if someone asks when the Paris Olympics begins and SearchGPT provides a date for the opening ceremony, it might link to a news story from Reuters. OpenAI said that online publishers such as Reuters are partnering with the company on the product. “We are committed to a thriving ecosystem of publishers and creators,” the company said, adding that the technology would highlight “high quality content in a conversational interface with multiple opportunities for users to engage.” The company also said that it was developing ways for publishers to manage how they appear in answers generated by the new search engine.   The New York Times has sued OpenAI and its partner, Microsoft, claiming copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems. The two companies have denied the suit’s claims.

OpenAI said that online publishers such as Reuters are partnering with the company on the product. “We are committed to a thriving ecosystem of publishers and creators,” the company said, adding that the technology would highlight “high quality content in a conversational interface with multiple opportunities for users to engage.” The company also said that it was developing ways for publishers to manage how they appear in answers generated by the new search engine.']\n",

      "Text: Google DeepMind says it has achieved a breakthrough in building an AI system that can handle complex mathematical problems. \n",
      "The research division, which is part of Alphabet-owned Google, announced Thursday that it has created a software system that combines multiple AI models and can score well-enough on the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO), a global test of high school students’ mathematical talents, to be in the top quartile of contestants taking the test. This would be good enough to obtain a silver medal in the competition.\n",
      "A boastworthy milestone in the machine-versus-mathlete contest, the feat also opens new possibilities for combining different approaches to AI in order to create more capable hybrid AI systems—something that Google said could eventually make its way into commercial products like its line-up of Gemini AI tools.\n",
      "The news was an advancement on a system that the AI research lab had unveiled in January, called AlphaGeometry, that could solve geometry problems from the IMO about as well as top high school students. The new system—which combines a new model called AlphaSolver and an updated and improved AlphaGeometry 2—can tackle all kinds of different mathematical problems and develop sophisticated answers.\n",
      "The new system managed to answer the most difficult IMO question, which only five of the 609 human contestants in last week’s competition managed to solve. That said, the new system is not perfect—on two of the six problems in the IMO, the new system did not manage to find a solution, and on one problem it took the system three days to reach the correct answer. Human competitors have to solve three questions in four-and-a-half hours, so can average no more than 90 minutes per question.\n",
      "Google DeepMind researchers said the new system is a step towards more powerful AI models that will be able to plan and reason about complex tasks, although they cautioned that the method would work best in situations where there was a clear way to determine if an output was a valid. This is the case, for example, in software coding where the code will only compile and run if it is valid. David Silver, one of the Google DeepMind researchers who worked on the new system, said it might also work in areas where humans could provide unambiguous feedback about whether the solution the AI produced was a good one.\n",
      "Google DeepMind said it would incorporate insights from the new system into future versions of its Gemini AI models, although they did not say exactly how this would be done or how soon Gemini might see these upgraded mathematical abilities.\n",
      "Silver acknowledged that in many real world situations the validity of an answer is highly subjective, or the soundness of a solution can only be determined after a long time period. He said this would make it harder to apply the methods Google DeepMind used for the IMO problems to successfully take on these kind of real world problems.\n",
      "AlphaZero to the rescue\n",
      "Unlike other well-known AI models that consist of a single large neural network—a kind of AI software loosely based on the human brain—the AlphaSolver system involves multiple neural networks, each performing different functions.\n",
      "A large language model (LLM)—in this case Google’s Gemini model—is used as one part of the process. But the LLM does not itself do the mathematical reasoning. LLMs which underpin popular AI chatbots—such as Gemini, OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Anthropic’s Claude, and Meta’s AI chatbot—have struggled with solving math problems unless given access to outside tools, such as calculators or specialized math software.\n",
      "Instead, the LLM is fine-tuned to translate text-based mathematical problems into a formal mathematical language. It then passes the problem to a different AI model, Google DeepMind’s AlphaZero, which was developed in 2017 and originally used to learn to play the strategy board games chess, go, and shogi at superhuman levels. But it turns out that AlphaZero can be used to puzzle out all kinds of problems in systems with clear rules and an easy way of keeping score.\n",
      "In this case, the AlphaZero component is trained to suggest proof steps to the problem in Lean, a mathematical programming language. If the proof step is valid, it will compile correctly in Lean. If it isn’t, it won’t. This provides a reward signal—much like points in a video game—to AlphaZero. In this way, the AlphaZero component of AlphaSolver, learns by trial and error to take steps that are more likely to result in valid solutions. AlphaSolver was trained on about one million of examples of IMO problems in the weeks leading up to the competition, Google DeepMind said, and it continued to improve while working on the IMO contest problems.\n",
      "In cases where the problem involved geometry, the problem was given instead to AlphaGeometry 2. AlphaGeometry 2 is also a hybrid system, combing an LLM component with a component that uses symbolic reasoning. The new AlphaGeometry could solve 83% of IMO geometry problems compared to just 53% for its predecessor. In one case, AlphaGeomerty was able to solve a highly complex geometry problem in just 19 seconds, a feat more akin to a flash of inspiration than a brute force approach based on endless trial and error. In another case, the proof AlphaGeometry offered initially confused some mathematicians who examined it, but they determined it was actually an elegant and highly-unusual way of solving the problem.\n",
      "Impact on human mathematicians\n",
      "Pushmeet Kohli, who heads Google DeepMind’s AI for science division, said he saw AlphaSolver and AlphaGeometry 2 primarily as tools for helping mathematicians in their work. Silver said he did not see these new mathematical AIs challenging the relevancy of academic mathematicians.\n",
      "But Timothy Gowers, who is a director of research in mathematics at the University of Cambridge and a past winner of the Fields Medal—a prize that is awarded only once every four years to two to four mathematicians under the age of 40 who have contributed the most to the field—reviewed the proofs AlphaSolver and AlphaGeometry 2 produced and said he came away impressed. “I could recognize familiar-looking arguments that had come out of the system,” he said.\n",
      "He also said that some of the problems required him, as a human mathematician, “to dig quite deep” and come up with what he called “a sort of magic key” that suddenly turns a problem that looks unsolvable into one that is imminently solvable. Gowers said he was surprised that the system had discovered a few of these magic keys because his intuition is that they would be difficult to stumble upon by naïve trial-and-error without any underlying understanding of the mathematical principles involved. But he said he reserved judgment as to whether this meant AlphaSolver had actually developed something akin to mathematical intuition. He said more research would be needed to understand more about exactly how the system managed to puzzle out answers to the IMO problems. \n",
      "Gowers noted that IMO problems were much simpler than what research mathematicians work on. But, compared to Kohli and Silver, Gowers was far less sanguine about what future would hold if AI models kept improving at the current clip. “I actually think that when computers become really good at finding extremely hard proofs, that’s more or less game over for mathematical research,” he said. “I’m not trying to suggest that we’re all that close to that at the moment, but I just, I’m thinking a long way ahead, but how long ahead that really is, is very hard to say.”   Recommended Newsletter:\n",

      "Highlights: ['The news was an advancement on a system that the AI research lab had unveiled in January, called AlphaGeometry, that could solve geometry problems from the IMO about as well as top high school students. The new system—which combines a new model called AlphaSolver and an updated and improved AlphaGeometry 2—can tackle all kinds of different mathematical problems and develop sophisticated answers. The new system managed to answer the most difficult IMO question, which only five of the 609 human contestants in last week’s competition managed to solve. That said, the new system is not perfect—on two of the six problems in the IMO, the new system did not manage to find a solution, and on one problem it took the system three days to reach the correct answer. Human competitors have to solve three questions in four-and-a-half hours, so can average no more than 90 minutes per question.']\n",

      "Text: New Jersey has a new plan to become the US hub for AI innovation. The state’s governor signed a law on Thursday that will offer up to $500 million in tax credits for artificial intelligence companies to set up shop in the state. “We want New Jerseyans to stand at the forefront of the AI revolution—and build a more prosperous world in the process,” New Jersey’s Governor, Phil Murphy, a Democrat, said in a statement. “And in so doing, we are going to establish New Jersey as the home-base for R&amp;D in generative AI.” AI companies and data centers that power AI that operate at large scales in New Jersey can qualify for the tax credits, which divert unspent funds from two other state tax credit programs for job creation and real estate development enacted in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Critics of the plan fear that it could be a win for profitable AI companies, but a loss for the state. Data centers typically require few employees, and tax incentives generally—including those thrown at tech companies—can prove costlier than what they return. In an analysis of the bill, New Jersey’s Office of Legislative Services, an agency in the state legislature that provides nonpartisan support, notes that it “cannot determine whether the bill will have a positive or negative net fiscal impact” on the state. The tax credits follow Murphy’s “AI Moonshot'' vision for New Jersey, announced early this year. Murphy has said he intended for the state’s actions to “establish New Jersey as the home base for AI-powered game-changers.” New Jersey’s own homegrown CoreWeave, a cloud provider for AI, recently raised $1.1 billion and is valued at $19 billion. And the state could multiply its market by capitalizing on the growing demand for data centers in the New York area: Vacancies for leased locations dropped from 9.7 percent to 6.5 percent from the beginning of 2023 to the second half of the year, according to a report from commercial real estate firm CBRE. The report also noted that an AI company has pre-leased space in East Windsor, a New Jersey town between New York and Philadelphia. And AI businesses are driving a surge in venture capital funding. These highly profitable companies need data centers to do business, and will put them somewhere—and they won’t need incentives to do it. “This is a growing, very healthy industry that does need any public support to do its business,” says Kasia Tarczynska, senior research analyst at Good Jobs First, a US national policy resource center that promotes corporate and government accountability in economic development. Data centers and companies working in AI are often eligible for general business tax incentives in the US. But those data center tax credits are “not particularly strategic,” says Tim Sullivan, CEO of the New Jersey Economic Development Authority. New Jersey’s plan is different from other states, he contends, because companies that benefit from the tax credit will have to reserve some computing power at discounted rates or provide AI support for smaller companies or universities. And while property in New Jersey isn’t cheap (it has the highest corporate tax rate in the US), proximity to large populations is highly valuable to data centers. Opening the sites closer to businesses helps to lower latency.   New Jersey itself is a home to many large pharmaceutical companies—and if these companies use AI to design new drugs, nearby data centers are vital, Sullivan says. “If you’re three people at a desk trying to develop the next Google, the next Tesla—in the AI space or in any space—this computing power is scarce. And it’s very valuable. It’s essential,” Sullivan says. So, in addition to any permanent jobs created by these companies, the tax incentives could lead to further growth and innovation for smaller startups, he claims. “The potential for economic impact is off the charts.” Still, policy experts are skeptical the AI carveout may just be a new bow on an older idea, coming as the AI boom creates a rapid increase in demand for data centers. “There’s just this history of [tax incentive] deals building up the necessary infrastructure for these tech firms and not paying off for the taxpayer,” says Pat Garofalo, director of state and local policy at the American Economic Liberties Project, a nonprofit organization that calls for government accountability. The loss in tax revenue “is often astronomical” when compared to each job created, Garofalo says. A 2016 report by Tarczynska showed that governments often forego more than $1 million in taxes for each job created when subsidizing data centers that are built by large companies, and many data centers create between 100 and 200 permanent jobs. The local impact may be small, but industry group The Data Center Coalition, an industry group, paints a different picture: each job at a data center supports more than six jobs elsewhere, a 2023 study it commissioned found. In other states, backlash against data centers is growing. Northern Virginia, home to a high concentration of data centers that sit close to Washington, D.C., has seen political shifts as people oppose the centers’ growing presence. In May, Georgia’s governor vetoed a bill that would have halted tax breaks for two years as the state studied the energy impact of the centers, which are rapidly expanding near Atlanta. This hasn’t deterred Big Tech companies’ expansion: In May, Microsoft announced it would build a new AI data center in Wisconsin, making a $3.3 billion investment and partnering with a local technical college to train and certify more than 1,000 students over the next five years to work in the new data center or IT jobs in the region. Google said just a month earlier it would build a $2 billion AI data center in Indiana, which is expected to create 200 jobs. Google will get a 35-year sales tax exemption in return if it makes an $800 million capital investment. In Europe, the same contradictory approach is playing out: Some cities including Amsterdam and Frankfurt, where companies have already set up data centers, are pushing new restrictions. In Ireland, data centers now account for one-fifth of the energy used in the country—more than all of the nation’s homes combined—raising concerns over their impact on the climate. Others are seeking out the economic opportunity: The Labour Party in the UK promised to make it easier to build data centers before emerging victorious in the recent UK election.   The New Jersey measure made its way through the state Legislature quickly in June—it was introduced and voted on by lawmakers in just weeks as the state finalized its budget. To qualify, the business must have half of its employees “engaged in AI-related activities,” or half of its revenue generated from AI-related activities. The companies must also make a minimum $100 million capital investment and create at least 100 new full-time jobs. The plan has gained support from the local business sector. “In the quickly evolving world of AI and with New Jersey’s high tax [and] high cost business climate, our state competitiveness matters,” says Christopher Emigholz, the chief government Affairs officer of the New Jersey Business &amp; Industry Association. New Jersey’s goal for this seems to be to elevate its status, to be “on the cutting edge” of the AI industry, says Peter Chen, a senior policy analyst with New Jersey Policy Perspective, a think tank. “Does this really get us there? AI is so broadly defined,” he says. “AI could be anything.” And the burgeoning AI industry has hang ups; generative AI needs excessive amounts of energy and water to function, some companies that develop large generative language and image models face accusations of copyright infringement, and large companies have been accused of rushing to develop the tech without proper safeguards. AI companies will ultimately build these centers—the tax incentives may just be added bonuses. Still, it’s something New Jersey hopes can entice big players closer. “We want to make sure that New Jersey is one on the leading edge of it,” Sullivan says. “Whatever happens, we want it to happen here.”   ||||I|||| Skip to main content\n",

      "Text: OpenAI is announcing its much-anticipated entry into the search market, SearchGPT, an AI-powered search engine with real-time access to information across the internet. The search engine starts with a large textbox that asks the user “What are you looking for?” But rather than returning a plain list of links, SearchGPT tries to organize and make sense of them. In one example from OpenAI, the search engine summarizes its findings on music festivals and then presents short descriptions of the events followed by an attribution link.  In another example, it explains when to plant tomatoes before breaking down different varieties of the plant. After the results appear, you can ask follow-up questions or click the sidebar to open other relevant links. There’s also a feature called “visual answers,” but OpenAI didn’t get back to The Verge before publication on exactly how this works.            An example of SearchGPT query.   Image: OpenAI    SearchGPT is just a “prototype” for now. The service is powered by the GPT-4 family of models and will only be accessible to 10,000 test users at launch, OpenAI spokesperson Kayla Wood tells The Verge. Wood says that OpenAI is working with third-party partners and using direct content feeds to build its search results. The goal is to eventually integrate the search features directly into ChatGPT. It’s the start of what could become a meaningful threat to Google, which has rushed to bake in AI features across its search engine, fearing that users will flock to competing products that offer the tools first. It also puts OpenAI in more direct competition with the startup Perplexity, which bills itself as an AI “answer” engine. Perplexity has recently come under criticism for an AI summaries feature that publishers claimed was directly ripping off their work.             SearchGPT’s “visual answers” feature showcases an AI-generated video from OpenAI’s Sora, via YouTube.   Image: OpenAI    OpenAI seems to have taken note of the blowback and says it’s taking a markedly different approach. In a blog post, the company emphasized that SearchGPT was developed in collaboration with various news partners, which include organizations like the owners of The Wall Street Journal, The Associated Press, and Vox Media, the parent company of The Verge. “News partners gave valuable feedback, and we continue to seek their input,” Wood says. Publishers will have a way to “manage how they appear in OpenAI search features,” the company writes. They can opt out of having their content used to train OpenAI’s models and still be surfaced in search.  “Responses have clear, in-line, named attribution and links  “SearchGPT is designed to help users connect with publishers by prominently citing and linking to them in searches,” according to OpenAI’s blog post. “Responses have clear, in-line, named attribution and links so users know where information is coming from and can quickly engage with even more results in a sidebar with source links.” Releasing its search engine as a prototype helps OpenAI in a few different ways. First, if SearchGPT’s results are wildly incorrect — like when Google rolled out AI Overviews and told us to put glue on our pizza — it’s easier to say, well, it’s a prototype! There’s also potential for getting attributions wrong or maybe wholesale ripping off articles like Perplexity was accused of doing.

We reported at the same time that OpenAI had been aggressively trying to poach Google employees for a search team. Some X users also noticed a new website OpenAI has been working on that hinted toward the move. OpenAI has slowly been bringing ChatGPT more in touch with the real-time web. When GPT-3.5 was released, the AI model was already months out of date. Last September, OpenAI released a way for ChatGPT to browse the internet, called Browse with Bing, but it appears a lot more rudimentary than SearchGPT. The rapid advancements by OpenAI have won ChatGPT millions of users, but the company’s costs are adding up.  The Information reported this week that OpenAI’s AI training and inference costs could reach $7 billion this year, with the millions of users on the free version of ChatGPT only further driving up compute costs. SearchGPT will be free during its initial launch, and since the feature appears to have no ads right now, it’s clear the company will have to figure out monetization soon.  ||||I|||| Skip to main content\n",

      "SearchGPT is just a “prototype” for now. The service is powered by the GPT-4 family of models and will only be accessible to 10,000 test users at launch, OpenAI spokesperson Kayla Wood tells The Verge. Wood says that OpenAI is working with third-party partners and using direct content feeds to build its search results. The goal is to eventually integrate the search features directly into ChatGPT.\n",
      "It’s the start of what could become a meaningful threat to Google, which has rushed to bake in AI features across its search engine, fearing that users will flock to competing products that offer the tools first.

      "Text: Big Tech appears to be tipping into troubled territory again.  In 2022, US tech companies grappled with falling demand after aggressive expansions during the pandemic, prompting a rout in tech stocks. However, the rush into artificial intelligence in 2023 reversed the decline, with the S&amp;P500 index gaining 40% since the start of 2023 while the tech-focused Nasdaq gained 60% over the same period.  Now, investors are getting impatient, with US stocks selling off amid questions about whether too much money is going to AI. Michael Strobaek, the global CIO at Swiss private bank Lombard Odier, wrote in a report released this week that major stock markets have been driven by \"investor optimism that we think borders on complacency.\" \"Enthusiasm for artificial intelligence has supercharged some US equities, driving the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq to new highs, yet leaving performance extremely concentrated in a few mega-cap names,\" Strobaek wrote. This concentration makes the effect of any major decline in Big Tech stocks even more pronounced. On Wednesday, all major US indices closed lower, with the Nasdaq Composite falling over 3% to mark its worst trading day since October 2022. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq 100  index lost $1 trillion, according to Bloomberg.  Among the losers were Wall Street AI chip darling Nvidia, which closed nearly 7% lower, and Alphabet, which closed 5% lower after reporting mixed second-quarter earnings.  Investors grilled Alphabet — Google's parent company — about how the company's AI initiatives were doing and their revenue-generating potential. However, Google executives provided few clues, Business Insider's Katherine Tangalakis-Lippert reported. All eyes on the rest of Big Tech Other Big Tech companies, including Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, and Meta, report quarterly earnings next week. After spending so much money on AI, investors will focus on what they can bring to the table in the near term. \n",

As Lombard Odier's Strobaek wrote, the risk of a market reversal is growing, but since tech was the big winner up until now, it's likely that some money will rotate to other stocks and sectors. As for Big Tech, it appears to be a case of being safe rather than being sorry — because they can afford to. In April, Google's AI boss said the company plans to invest more than $100 billion over time in  AI technology development.   \"When we go through a curve like this, the risk of underinvesting is dramatically greater than the risk of over-investing for us here, even in scenarios where if it turns out that we are over-investing,\" said Google CEO Sundar Pichai during the Tuesday earnings call.  ||||I|||| A vertical stack of three evenly spaced horizontal lines.
